## Getting Started

### Use the Github template
First, click the green `Use this template` button near the top of this page.
This will take you to Github's ['Generate Repository'](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project/generate) page. 
Fill in a repository name and short description, and click 'Create repository from template'. 
This will allow you to create a new repository in your Github account, 
prepopulated with the contents of this project. 
Now you can clone the project locally and get to work!

    $ git clone https://github.com/<user>/<your_new_repo>.git

### Remove frameworks you're not going to use
If you know you're not going to use one or more of the optional gui/graphics 
frameworks (fltk, gtkmm, imgui, etc.), you can remove them with `git rm`:

    $ git rm -r src/<unnecessary_framework>

## Dependencies

Note about install commands: 
- for Windows, we use [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install).
- for MacOS, we use [brew](https://brew.sh/). 
- In case of an error in cmake, make sure that the dependencies are on the PATH.

### Necessary Dependencies
1. A C++ compiler that supports C++17.
See [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support)
to see which features are supported by each compiler.
The following compilers should work:

  * [gcc 7+](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
	<details>
	<summary>Install command</summary>

	- Debian/Ubuntu:
		
			sudo apt install build-essential

	- Windows:
		
			choco install mingw -y

	- MacOS:
		
			brew install gcc
	</details>

  * [clang 6+](https://clang.llvm.org/)
	<details>
	<summary>Install command</summary>

	- Debian/Ubuntu:
		
			bash -c "$(wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh)"

	- Windows:

		Visual Studio 2019 ships with LLVM (see the Visual Studio section). However, to install LLVM separately:
		
			choco install llvm -y
			
		llvm-utils for using external LLVM with Visual Studio generator:
			
			git clone https://github.com/zufuliu/llvm-utils.git
			cd llvm-utils/VS2017
			.\install.bat

	- MacOS:
 		
			brew install llvm
	</details>

  * [Visual Studio 2017 or higher](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
	<details>
	<summary>Install command + Environment setup</summary>

	On Windows, you need to install Visual Studio because of the SDK and libraries that ship with it 
	(the minimum compiler version is 19.15, which ships with version 15.8 of the IDE).

  	Visual Studio IDE - 2019 Community (installs Clang too):
		
  	  	choco install -y visualstudio2019community --package-parameters "add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --includeRecommended --includeOptional --passive --locale en-US"
		
	Put MSVC compiler, Clang compiler, and vcvarsall.bat on the path:

			choco install vswhere -y
			refreshenv
			
			$clpath = vswhere -latest -prerelease -find **/Hostx64/x64/*   # for x64
			[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$clpath", "User")
			
			$clangpath = vswhere -latest -prerelease -find **/Llvm/bin/*
			[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$clangpath", "User")

			$vcvarsallpath =  vswhere -latest -prerelease -find **/Auxiliary/Build/*
			[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$vcvarsallpath", "User")
			refreshenv

	</details>

#### GUI libraries
This project can be made to work with several optional GUI frameworks.

If desired, you should install the following optional dependencies as
directed by their documentation, linked here:
 
- [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/doc-1.4/index.html)
- [GTKMM](https://www.gtkmm.org/en/documentation.html)
- [QT](https://doc.qt.io/)

The following dependencies can be downloaded automatically by CMake and Conan. 
All you need to do to install them is to turn on a CMake flag during 
configuration.
If you run into difficulty using them, please refer to their documentation,
linked here:

- [NANA](http://nanapro.org/en-us/documentation/)
- [SDL](http://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage)
- [IMGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/docs): 
  This framework depends on SFML, and if you are using Linux, you may need
  to install several of SFML's dependencies using your package manager. See 
  [the SFML build tutorial](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php)
  for specifics.

## Build Instructions

### Build directory
Make a build directory:
```
mkdir build
```
### Specify the compiler using environment variables

By default (if you don't set environment variables `CC` and `CXX`), the system default compiler will be used.

Conan and CMake use the environment variables CC and CXX to decide which compiler to use. So to avoid the conflict issues only specify the compilers using these variables.

CMake will detect which compiler was used to build each of the Conan targets. If you build all of your Conan targets with one compiler, and then build your CMake targets with a different compiler, the project may fail to build.

<details>
<summary>Commands for setting the compilers </summary>

- Debian/Ubuntu/MacOS:
	
	Set your desired compiler (`clang`, `gcc`, etc):
		
	- Temporarily (only for the current shell)
	
		Run one of the followings in the terminal:
	
		- clang
		
				CC=clang CXX=clang++
			
		- gcc
		
				CC=gcc CXX=g++
	
	- Permanent:

		Open `~/.bashrc` using your text editor:
			
			gedit ~/.bashrc
			
		Add `CC` and `CXX` to point to the compilers:
			
			export CC=clang
			export CXX=clang++
			
		Save and close the file.

- Windows:

	- Permanent:
	
		Run one of the followings in PowerShell:
				
		- Visual Studio generator and compiler (cl)
			
				[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CC", "cl.exe", "User")
				[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CXX", "cl.exe", "User")
				refreshenv
			
		  Set the architecture using [vsvarsall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2019#vcvarsall-syntax):
			
				vsvarsall.bat x64

		- clang

				[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CC", "clang.exe", "User")
				[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CXX", "clang++.exe", "User")
				refreshenv
	 
		- gcc

				[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CC", "gcc.exe", "User")
				[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CXX", "g++.exe", "User")
				refreshenv
	 

  - Temporarily (only for the current shell):
		
			$Env:CC="clang.exe"
			$Env:CXX="clang++.exe"
			
</details>

### Configure your build

To configure the project and write makefiles, you could use `cmake` with a bunch of command line options.
The easier option is to run cmake interactively:

#### **Configure via cmake-gui**:

1) Open cmake-gui from the project directory:
```
cmake-gui .
```
2) Set the build directory:

![build_dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82524586-fa48e380-9af4-11ea-8514-4e18a063d8eb.jpg)

3) Configure the generator:

In cmake-gui, from the upper menu select `Tools/Configure`.

**Warning**: if you have set `CC` and `CXX` always choose the `use default native compilers` option. This picks `CC` and `CXX`. Don't change the compiler at this stage!

<details>
<summary>Windows - MinGW Makefiles</summary>

Choose MinGW Makefiles as the generator:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82769479-616ade80-9dfa-11ea-899e-3a8c31d43032.png" alt="mingw">

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows - Visual Studio generator and compiler</summary>

You should have already set `C` and `CXX` to `cl.exe`.

Choose "Visual Studio 16 2019" as the generator:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82524696-32502680-9af5-11ea-9697-a42000e900a6.jpg" alt="default_vs">

</details>

<details>

<summary>Windows - Visual Studio generator and Clang Compiler</summary>

You should have already set `C` and `CXX` to `clang.exe` and `clang++.exe`.

Choose "Visual Studio 16 2019" as the generator. To tell Visual studio to use `clang-cl.exe`:
- If you use the LLVM that is shipped with Visual Studio: write `ClangCl` under "optional toolset to use". 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82781142-ae60ac00-9e1e-11ea-8c77-222b005a8f7e.png" alt="visual_studio">

- If you use an external LLVM: write [`LLVM_v142`](https://github.com/zufuliu/llvm-utils#llvm-for-visual-studio-2017-and-2019)
 under "optional toolset to use".

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82769558-b3136900-9dfa-11ea-9f73-02ab8f9b0ca4.png" alt="visual_studio">

</details>
<br/>

4) Choose the Cmake options and then generate:

![generate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16418197/82781591-c97feb80-9e1f-11ea-86c8-f2748b96f516.png)

#### **Configure via ccmake**:
with the Cmake Curses Dialog Command Line tool:  

    ccmake .

Once `ccmake` has finished setting up, press 'c' to configure the project, 
press 'g' to generate, and 'q' to quit.

### Build
Once you have selected all the options you would like to use, you can build the 
project (all targets):

    cmake --build ./build

For Visual Studio, give the build configuration (Release, RelWithDeb, Debug, etc) like the following:

	cmake --build ./build -- /p:configuration=Release

## Troubleshooting

### Update Conan
Many problems that users have can be resolved by updating Conan, so if you are 
having any trouble with this project, you should start by doing that.

To update conan: 

    $ pip install --user --upgrade conan 

You may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` in this command, depending on your 
platform.

### Clear Conan cache
If you continue to have trouble with your Conan dependencies, you can try 
clearing your Conan cache:

    $ conan remove -f '*'
    
The next time you run `cmake` or `cmake --build`, your Conan dependencies will
be rebuilt. If you aren't using your system's default compiler, don't forget to 
set the CC, CXX, CMAKE_C_COMPILER, and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables, as 
described in the 'Build using an alternate compiler' section above.

### Identifying misconfiguration of Conan dependencies

If you have a dependency 'A' that requires a specific version of another 
dependency 'B', and your project is trying to use the wrong version of 
dependency 'B', Conan will produce warnings about this configuration error 
when you run CMake. These warnings can easily get lost between a couple 
hundred or thousand lines of output, depending on the size of your project. 

If your project has a Conan configuration error, you can use `conan info` to 
find it. `conan info` displays information about the dependency graph of your 
project, with colorized output in some terminals.

    $ cd build
    $ conan info .

In my terminal, the first couple lines of `conan info`'s output show all of the
project's configuration warnings in a bright yellow font. 

For example, the package `spdlog/1.5.0` depends on the package `fmt/6.1.2`.
If you were to modify the file `cmake/Conan.cmake` so that it requires an 
earlier version of `fmt`, such as `fmt/6.0.0`, and then run:

    $ conan remove -f '*'       # clear Conan cache
    $ rm -rf build              # clear previous CMake build
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..                  # rebuild Conan dependencies
    $ conan info .

...the first line of output would be a warning that `spdlog` needs a more recent
version of `fmt`.
